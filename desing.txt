Induce myself
Explain my projects


I'm Samuel Aydelotte. I caught the coding bug at the age of 13 when i took my first python course tought by Mr. Boothby. Fast forward, I Graduted High School my high at 16 and dove headfirst into college at 17. I Like to code stupid useless projects, thats what keeps me motivated in classes of algorithmic thinking,
Projects:
. Control AI if Voice
- I saw a youtuber Named DougDoug and he had programmed an itnerface with chatgpt that would allow you to talk to chagpt and chatgpt would play a haracter. Digging into the code I found you had to pay for 3 seperate services to get the code to run. So I took it upon myself to make the code work for free.
